WhteRbtFileInspectionsBundle
============================

The WhteRbtFileInspectionsBundle makes it real easy to inspect all files reachable
by the bundle.

Add some jobs and inspect the files for existence, date and content. Decide if
you want to receive some email receipts after the inspectors have finished their
work.

Just add the configuration and an old fashioned cron job and you're set.
